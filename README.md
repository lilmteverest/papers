# real-stable-polynomials

This paper is an exposition on two classes of polynomials, real-rooted polynomials and real
stable polynomials, and how real stable polynomials are a generalization of real-rooted polynomi-
als. We also explore combinatorial applications of both real-rooted polynomials and real stable
polynomials,  rst using real-rooted polynomials to prove the well-known Newton's inequalities.
This paper culminates in a break-through proof of the existence of an in nite sequence of regular
bipartite Ramanujan graphs that utilizes real stable polynomials in an innovative way.
